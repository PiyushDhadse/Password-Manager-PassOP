# 🔐 PassOP - Your Own Password Manager

PassOP is a simple yet powerful password manager built with **React**.  
It allows you to securely store, manage, and interact with your credentials (sitename, username, and password).  

The application comes in **two variants**:
1. **LocalStorage Variant** – Stores data directly in the browser's localStorage.
2. **MongoDB Variant** – Uses a backend (`server.js`) with MongoDB Compass to persist data and perform CRUD operations.
